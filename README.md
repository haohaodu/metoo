# 1. Overview

- NodeJS and ExpressJS:
  - Our frontend is primarily Javascript-based and as a result, I chose to use NodeJS as our backend framework so that I and future developers can seamlessly work full stack
- MongoDB and Mongoose:
  - In another context we may have chosen a SQL database but we are currently looking for speed of development and so we went with NoSQL. As we are opting for speed of development we opted to couple Mongoose with MongoDB. Another option we considered was Firebase / Firestore but chose MongoDB because it would be more high-performant as we scale.
